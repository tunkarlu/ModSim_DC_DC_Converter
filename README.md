Experiment DC to DC Converter

***This project is part of AVE3 pratical course for Modelling and Simulation.
This experiment is to convert a DC voltage level to desired DC output voltage level.
For instance, high-voltage battery is converted in to typically 12V to be used by on-board electrical network in EV.
Switching of MOSFET is realised in the system by switching between two input voltage Uin and -UD.
Two different loads characterised by lookup tables are used.
Parameterisation as well as tuning of R loss is done.
